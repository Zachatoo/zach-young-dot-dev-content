I decided to convert my personal website from JavaScript to TypeScript.
During the process I had the question: "How do I handle the children prop?"

Let's answer this question by converting this simple React component from JavaScript to TypeScript:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
const Button = ({ className, children }) => {
  return (
    <button className={className}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

Here are a few solutions I found:

## PropsWithChildren Type

This was the simplest solution and the one I ended up implementing.
`PropsWithChildren` is a generic type that can be passed a type which will then return that same type with an added `children` type.
Sounds confusing if you're not familiar with generics, however in my eyes this solution looks the cleanest.

```tsx /PropsWithChildren/
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";

interface Props {
  className: string;
}

const Button = ({ className, children }: PropsWithChildren<Props>) => {
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
};
```

## FunctionalComponent (FC) Type

This solution is similar to the previous solution, however instead of using a generic type for the props, we use a generic type for the component.
I don't find this solution to be as readable as the previous solution, but it works exactly the same.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx /FC/
import { FC } from "react";

interface Props {
  className: string;
}

const Button: FC<Props> = ({ className, children }) => {
  return (
    <button className={className}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

## ReactNode Type

In this solution we add the children prop to the type ourselves. The above solutions essentially do the same thing, however here we do the work ourselves.
We could also use `ReactChild` or `ReactElement` here, however they don't account for all potential children types such as strings, booleans, etc.
I don't prefer this method as I like to have code abstracted away from me,
however it can be useful in certain situations where it doesn't make sense to use the other solutions.

```tsx /ReactNode/
import { ReactNode } from "react";

interface Props {
  className: string;
  children?: ReactNode | undefined;
}

const Button: = ({ className, children }: Props) => {
  return (
    <button className={className}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

## What if I only want to pass children?

For our first two solutions, we can pass an empty interface as the type parameter to the generic type.
This will give us a type that only has `children` as a property type on it.
For our last solution, we can only include the `children` property type.
Let's look at the previous examples and redo them with only `children` as a prop.

```tsx
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";

interface Props {}

const Button = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren<Props>) => {
  return <button>{children}</button>;
};
```

```tsx
import { FC } from "react";

interface Props {}

const Button: FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  return <button>{children}</button>;
};
```

```tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";

interface Props {
  children?: ReactNode | undefined;
}

const Button: = ({ children }: Props) => {
  return <button>{children}</button>;
};
```
